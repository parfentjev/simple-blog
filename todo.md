# To do list

- ✔️Post status - visible:
  - Feed: return only visible=true.
  - by ID: return only visible=true.
  - `db.posts.updateMany({}, { $set: { visible: true } })`
- ✔️Token generation by username:password (`token.secret`, `token.issuer`, `token.lifespan`)
- ✔️Categories.
  - `db.posts.updateMany({}, { $set: { category: "Miscellaneous" } })`
- ✔️POST/PUT/DELETE posts.
- ✔️Add ~~service~~ and ~~controller~~ tests: decided to make integration tests instead.
- ✔️Update frontend to support editing and categories.
- ✔️RSS feed
  - Separate script to generate a static file?
  - There's no need to generate it dynamically.
  - Maybe spring boot has some built-in cache.
- ❌ ActivityPub for subscribers
  - Optional, because I don't really need this.
  - But it'd be interesting to see how the protocol works.

- ✔ Check if feed.xml is truly needed in the container, because now it'd override real feed wih a placeholder on each build
- ✔ Add link to the RSS feed in the webapp
- ✔ Do something with the navbar on small screens, it doesn't look good
- ✔ See if a test can be created for the RSS generator
- Add an endpoint for the webapp to refresh tokens
- Move MongoDB from cloud to local container
